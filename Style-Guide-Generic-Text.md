## Default Subtitle Style guidelines 
(Displays when it is a non-team video or the team doesn't have specific guidelines configured.)

Here are a few basic styling guidelines that will help make your captions clear, easy to follow and accessible to all users. 

* **Subtitle line length**: Try to keep subtitle length to about 42 characters per line with no more than 2 lines. A helper box displays as you edit subtitles, showing your line length. Avoid breaking grammatical units or proper names when placing a line break.
* **Minimum and maximum duration**: Subtitles shouldn't last less than 1 second or more than 7. If a subtitle lasts more than seven seconds, split it into two subtitles.
* **Simultaneous dialogue**: Start with a hyphen and a space subtitles with 2 speakers. Dialogue hyphens are used exclusively when two speakers talk in the same subtitle. Each speaker should have one line, and both lines should have an hyphen.
* **Maximum timing offset**: Avoid synchronizing a subtitle too early or too late for the audio it corresponds to. Ideally the maximum offset shouldn't be more than 0.5 seconds. Also, subtitles shouldn't stay on screen longer than necessary after the end of the audio bit.
* **Reading speed**: The reading speed is displayed in the helper box as characters per second. The recommended reading speed is 8-25 characters/second (16 for children programming). 
* **On-screen texts**: Whenever there's enough time in the subtitle track for it, translate the texts on the video that are relevant to the plot. If you are transcribing the video and the texts are in the same language, your team may want to have them transcribed to make the translators' job easier and to remove them when the translations are done.
* **Indicate inaudible parts**: If a part of the audio is definitely inaudible, it should be marked as [inaudible]. Don’t forget the square brackets.
* **Translate the whole idea**: You don't need to translate subtitle by subtitle individually. Look at the context to make sure you are using the correct punctuation for the whole unit of text.
* **Use meaningful speech**: Exclude things like “um” “ah” and other disfluencies.
* **Sounds**:  Describe meaningful sounds that are relevant to the plot. ex: (water dripping)
* **Music**: Describe relevant music which doesn’t have relevant lyrics. ex: ♪ (jazz music) ♪
* **Lyrics**: Wrap relevant lyrics in musical notes. ex ♪ *Tell me dear Billy,* ♪
* **Speaker identification**: Identify off-screen and unclear speakers in parentheses. ex: (Michael) Wait for me!
* **Foreign language**: Identify relevant speech in foreign language. ex: (Russian): Thank you.
