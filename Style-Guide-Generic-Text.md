## Transcribing and Translating Guidelines 
(editor default guidelines can be the same for both)

Here are a few basic styling guidelines that will help make your captions clear, easy to follow and accessible to all users. 

* **Subtitle line length**: Try to keep subtitle length to about 42 characters per line with no more than 2 lines.  A helper box displays as you edit subtitles, showing your line length.
* **Subtitle timings**: Avoid creating captions of a very short duration. It's better to merge lines so they are more readable.
* **Captions dialogue**: Hyphenate subtitles with 2 speakers.  Dialogue hyphens are used exclusively when two speakers talk in the same subtitle. Each speaker should have one line, and both lines should have an hyphen.
* **Indicate inaudible parts**: If a part of the audio is definitely inaudible, it should be marked as [inaudible]. Don’t forget the square brackets.
* **Translate the whole idea**: You don't need to translate subtitle by subtitle individually. Look at the context to make sure you are using the correct punctuation for the whole unit of text.
* **Use meaningful speech**: Exclude things like “um” “ah” and other disfluencies.
* **Sounds**:  Describe meaningful sounds that are relevant to the plot. ex: (water dripping)
* **Music**: Describe relevant music which doesn’t have relevant lyrics. ex: ♪ (jazz music) ♪
* **Lyrics**: Wrap relevant lyrics in musical notes. ex ♪ *Tell me dear Billy,* ♪
* **Speaker identification**: Identify off-screen and unclear speakers in parentheses. ex: (Michael) Wait for me!
* **Foreign language**: Identify relevant speech in foreign language. ex: (Russian): Thank you.
