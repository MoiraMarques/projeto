|**On-screen texts**|Translate the texts on the video that are relevant to the plot. |
|**Use meaningful speech**| Exclude things like “um” “ah” and other disfluencies.|
|**Indicate inaudible parts**|If the audio is inaudible, it should be marked as [inaudible]. |
|**Lyrics**|Wrap relevant lyrics in musical notes. <br/>ex ♪ *Tell me dear Billy,* ♪|
|**Speaker identification**|Identify off-screen and unclear speakers in parentheses. <br/> ex: (Michael) Wait for me!|
