## Amara Style Guide
####Here are a few basic styling guidelines that will help make your captions clear, easy to follow and accessible to all users. 

As you type a subtitle, a helper box displays to right providing details about the number of characters, number of lines and the reading rate (the numbers of characters per second).

**Subtitle line length**: Keep subtitle length to about 42 characters and avoid more than 2 lines per subtitle.

**Minimum duration**: Subtitles should not be less than 1 second.

**Maximum duration**: Split subtitles lasting more than 7 seconds.

**Use meaningful speech**: Exclude things like “um” “ah” and other disfluencies.

**Sounds**:  Describe meaningful sounds that are relevant to the plot. ex: (water dripping)

**Music**: Describe relevant music which does not have relevant lyrics. ex: ♪ (jazz music) ♪

**Reading speed**:  8-25 characters/second is recommended, 8-16 characters/second for children.

**Translate the whole idea**: You don't need to translate subtitle by subtitle individually. Look at the context to make sure you are using the correct punctuation for the whole unit of text.

**Simultaneous dialogue**:  Dialogue hyphens are used exclusively when two speakers talk in the same subtitle. 
 - Start with a hyphen and a space subtitles with 2 speakers.
 - Each speaker should have one line, and both lines should have an hyphen.

**Maximum timing offset**: Subtitles shouldn't start more than 0.5 seconds before or after the audio begins.  Also, subtitles shouldn't stay on screen longer than necessary after the end of the audio bit. 

**On-screen texts**: Translate the texts on the video that are relevant to the plot. 

**Indicate inaudible parts**: If the audio is inaudible, it should be marked as [inaudible]. 

**Lyrics**: Wrap relevant lyrics in musical notes. ex ♪ *Tell me dear Billy,* ♪

**Speaker identification**: Identify off-screen and unclear speakers in parentheses. ex: (Michael) Wait for me!

**Foreign language**: Identify relevant speech in foreign language. ex: (Russian): Thank you.
