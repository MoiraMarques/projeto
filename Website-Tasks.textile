h2. The Tasks

# Implement "recent activity" list on front page
## First, add a @datetime_started@ to @TranslationVersion@, just like @VideoCaptionVersion@. Use South for this, and make it so that we can apply the migration using deploy/fabfile.py.
## Show ten most recent activities in "recent activity" list, where an activity is a @TranslationVersion@ or @VideoCaptionVersion@. Present the activities like "USERNAME edited subtitles for VIDEO at 2:10 pm" and "USERNAME edited Spanish translations for VIDEO at 2:11 pm" where USERNAME and VIDEO are actual names with links to the profile page and video page, respectively. 
# Alter @videos.views.video_list@ and the corresponding template:
#* make lists sortable (with up/down arrows)
#* fix "translation count" and display of translation numbers
#* some URLs are blank (are they Youtube videos identified by video iD? they should show youube URL).  
#* Remove transcription column since we're only allowing one, 
#* Add columns "views" and have a number based on the number of times somebody "views" the widget (times the widget is loaded.
#* "subtitles fetched" should the number of times the widget requests subtitles in any language.
#* Use Django defaults whenever possible, drop things that don't mesh with Django defaults.
# Add feedback form and a mailto link ("or <a mailto="">email us directly</a>") to all pages except front page under the heading "Send us your feedback!"  Form lets user enter in an email address (not required) and a message with a "send feedback" button.    Emails to feedback@universalsubtitles.org.  We will be making a few static pages with this feedback form, so also make us a static page with the form on it that we can use as a template.  
# Add copyright Participatory Culture Foundation and AGPL license information to everywhere necessary, listing license info for other packages we use as necessary. http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html
