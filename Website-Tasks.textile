h2. The Tasks

* Please merge your code into master and delete the branch
* I noticed you're using this code:

bc.    def translation_count(self):
        return self.translationlanguage_set.count()

    for translation count. Does this run n+1 select statements for a table of n rows? If so, please store the translation count as a column called translation_count in the Video table. A good place to update the value with the database count is widget.views.finished_translations.
# Please add a subtitles_fetched_count column to Video. Value for existing rows should be initialized to 1 (using South?). The value can be incremented by one whenever fetch_captions or fetch_translations (in widget.views) is called. Please present this value in the video list table.
# Please add a widget_views_count column to Video. Value for existing rows should be initialized to 1 (using South?). This can be incremented whenever widget.views.embed is called. Please present the value in the video list table.
# Please move the RPC methods in widget.views to a separate module. The RPC methods are everything under "# start of rpc methods". Please alter widget.views.rpc and widget.views.xd_rpc to point to new module.
# Add feedback form and a mailto link ("or <a mailto="">email us directly</a>") to all pages except front page under the heading "Send us your feedback!"  Form lets user enter in an email address (not required) and a message with a "send feedback" button.    Emails to feedback@universalsubtitles.org.  We will be making a few static pages with this feedback form, so also make us a static page with the form on it that we can use as a template.  
# Get most recent version of widget (http://mswidgetstaging.8planes.com/widget-demo.rb?video_url=http://videos.mozilla.org/firefox3/switch/switch.ogg&null) working on the "submit video" page (and front page) of the website (right now, there's an old version of the widget.
# Add copyright Participatory Culture Foundation and AGPL license information to everywhere necessary, listing license info for other packages we use as necessary. http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html
