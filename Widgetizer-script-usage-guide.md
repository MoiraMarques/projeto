This small bit of javascript can be added to the <header> of your template and then every YouTube or html5 video on the site will have the subtitle tab attached below.

**To use it:** add the following code just above \</header\> in your CMS template. We also have a plugin that can do this automatically for wordpress sites.

`<script type="text/javascript" src="http://s3.www.universalsubtitles.org/js/mirosubs-widgetizer.js"></script>`

**Demo:** http://universalsubtitles.org/widget/widgetize_demo.html

*Caveat: certain formats that we support must use the flowplayer skin, in order to give us necessary timing data so that we can sync the subtitles to the video.*
