h2. Priority ordering (milestone: nail down rough edges in widget as it exists)

# -Add "Please login"/username to widget dialog.-
# -Clicking on the spinner controls should start playback from that new set point (even if video was paused).   Holding the spinner should pause playback, and then play at the newly set point on release.-  
# Restart is not working in the review stage.  In all stages, restart should stop the video and set playhead to 0.
# Try ctrl/tab with nightly build from Mozilla.
# Expand widget when you submit video on universalsubtitles site: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/95 (might be done already?)
# When the widget displays a video in a page (user has not clicked subtitle me to open dialog) don't change the size of the video.
# When browser can't play HTML5 video show an error message "Sorry, your browser can't play HTML5/Ogg video.  <a>Try Firefox</a>"  in video playback area.  
# Show good error message in video playback area using the "alert" icon that we use for "you need to login" when video link is broken / video removed from yt: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/9
# QUESTION: Can users go back in and edit "finished" subtitles that they "own"?  If not, that ticket should be in this list.
# Add copyright Participatory Culture Foundation and AGPL license information to everywhere necessary, listing license info for other packages we use as necessary. http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html .

# New round of HTML fixes from Morgan.  Hopefully down to #12 (IE testing, fixes)


h3. Iterative projects
# 2nd try at autopause: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/110
# First run at timeline view: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/73
# Make Atul's jetpack extension work
# Revisioning aka Wikimode
# Send email to Michael Dale about widget API and him using it (ask Nick first where this is at)

h3. Medium priority, nice to have, maybe we don't care:

# Empty subs display "silence": https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/84
# BUG: When I'm holding down the spacebar and I let go briefly and hold down again,  the subtitle on the video overlay does not advance, even though the subtitle in the list (and as far as I can tell, the transition being recorded) does advance.  Subtitle on the screen should advance with the subtitles in the list.  
# If user is holding down spacebar and lifts up and pushes down again "immediately" (in less than 0.1 or 0.2 seconds?) then no previously recorded transition should happen in that time (talk to holmes about this). 
# Subtitle onscreen should change when user edits title https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/106
# Make Google accounts work using openID.
# Adding and deleting lines: http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12975
# Machine translation: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/109
# Behavior for user logging out during subtitle authoring http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12961

h2. Critical things on the website

# "Recent activity" list of recently touched video on front page working or removed
# On site: All Videos" tab remove from nav or make it work / useful
#* make lists sortable (with up/down arrows)
#* fix "translation count" and display of translation numbers
#* some URL's are blank (are they Youtube videos identified by video iD? they should show youube URL).  
#* Remove transcription column since we're only allowing one, 
#* Add columns "views" and have a number based on the number of times somebody "views" the widget (times the widget is loaded.
#* "subtitles fetched" should the number of times the widget requests subtitles in any language.
#* Use Django defaults whenever possible, drop things that don't mesh with Django defaults.
# Add feedback form and a mailto link ("or <a mailto="">email us directly</a>") to all pages except front page under the heading "Send us your feedback!"  Form lets user enter in an email address (not required) and a message with a "send feedback" button.    Emails to feedback@universalsubtitles.org.  We will be making a few static pages with this feedback form, so maybe just make us a static page we can copy.  
# Add copyright Participatory Culture Foundation and AGPL license information to everywhere necessary, listing license info for other packages we use as necessary. http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html

h2. Morgan's Design / XHTML /CSS list.

# Make video player (see email from Holmes)
# login window -> HTML
# Need green box "To begin, press TAB to play and start typing!" in the Transcribe view (see mockups)
# Without timeline, dialog is too short in sync & review modes.Elements on right overlap.  
# Morgan--can you make a design that uses / sizes youtube videos and HTML5 of different aspect ratios to not look f'ed?  If you do it by making the bottom left quadrant variable height, make sure the "press TAB to play" button looks good".
# Related: when video is a different height / aspect ratio than the area we've provided, make sure it looks nice.
# Put a "back" arrow next to "return to transcribe mode" in "edit.html" (see email "HTML for "Edit" functionality in widget") 
# Make HTML based on mockups for FINISHED screen (see email "tweaked post subtitles page")
# Make HTML based on "how-to video" mockup that Holmes sent.
# Safari video player and titles alignment bug (see two emails for screenshots) The video player in the widget view displays in the wrong place, even though the video displays in the correct place.  If this is some weird and hard to fix safari bug, let it stay broken.
# Another Safari issue: I think the subtitles may be appearing too high in the video compared to the Firefox ones.  Not sure.
# Test the widget in IE 7 / IE 8 and fix any CSS issues.  
# When clicking "Done" in Review state, we contact the server. Need
to show loading thing here.  HW: Let's use the first spinner (from the first widget, or something similar) right on the metal button in the space to the left of "Done"
# We're thinking the green color on the "Subtitle Me" button and the logo looks way too pukey.   Can you make it brighter?
# Make HTML of transcribe/review with no 3D styling, edge around timestamps, just the text on the background, and make timestamp spinner buttons larger.  This can be a graphical draft to discuss, or HTML.  Let us know as soon as this is done so we can discuss.
# dropdown: make the "choose language" tab with the divider and down arrow (see layer in PSD nick sent).
# make a "+" button (this could just be a small white "+" or it could have a circle around it) somewhere near the center corner where the video, the instructions, and the list of subtitles meet.  This should change to "minus" when timeline view appears.  Send Adam and Holmes a note that it's there, and should hide / remove.
# In Sync or Review, try double-clicking on sub. The elements overlap a bit, so we need some design help here.
# White outline of widget is transparent.  It shouldn't be.
# "Download SRT" shouldn't be styled as a link... it should look like any other button (see email screenshot)
# grey dotted outline when you click in the widget dialog, this isn't a firefox extension, is it?  (see screenshot below)
# The subtitle text must be centered in the div and not in the video, so it sometimes gets too close to the left margin.
# There's a band of white down the right side of the box, not covered by the subtitling image.  
# Nick made a few tweaks to the dropdown CSS here (see email).  He changed the font, the positioning (left instead of right) and the menu color.  Can you incorporate these?
# The rotating logo isn't visible enough as a loading indicator.  One possible solution: replace it with a spinner that sits on the metal tab and temporarily replaces the green logo
# When the bottom left of an HTML5 video is very white, the button is sort of floating.  Perhaps the button should include an edge in the bottom left hand corner that goes up and right just enough to define that bottom corner, and fades from grey to white, one pixel wide?

h2. Non acted-upon suggestions from first round of user testing

(I wanted to leave these somewhere as a reference)

* It would be useful to be able to change the subtitle text and color before completing the project; and also to be able to import a text file in the event the video had been transcribed earlier.  
* Adding a transcript: if somebody pastes a ton of text with linebreaks into the transcription box, we should treat those as separate lines and fill them in.  Two linebreaks is "silence".  Let somebody upload SRT.
* Make backspace (when not editing) work like "undo" for transcribe and sync, and show in key controls list.
* The "Start Over" link should be available on every tab.   In review, it should ask the user "do you want to delete all syncing information and start over?  Yes, delete all  /  No, just rewind to beginning" with No as default.  On the transcribe page it should say "do you really want to delete everything and start over? Yes, delete everything. /  No, don't delete" with no as default
* For morgan: restore start over button visibility.  Somebody thought it was too faint.
