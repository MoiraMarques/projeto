h2. Critical Stuff for next round of development

# Fix small problem (subtitles in overlay still advance when holding spacebar): https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/23
# New HTML
# "embed code" displayed on final "thanks for submitting" page of widget is not an embed code, it's just a link.  This field should include embed code, as shown on site (something that can be pasted into html to load video).
# Open ID login works https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/4 https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/89
# let users Create account (in widget in dropdown menu, and in login button) http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13079
and then move it back to universalsubtitles.org/  ... right now at universalsubtitles.org/front/ (l: universal pw: subtitles) all links are broken.
# Add "turn off subtitles" to dropdown: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/88
# Editing on timestamp: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/78

h2. Critical things on the website

# "Recent activity" list of recently touched video on front page working or removed
# On site: All Videos" tab remove from nav or make it work / useful
#* make lists sortable (with up/down arrows)
#* fix "translation count" and display of translation numbers
#* some URL's are blank (are they Youtube videos identified by video iD? they should show youube URL).  
#* Remove transcription column since we're only allowing one,
#* Change "subtitles fetched" to "subtitles viewed" and have a number based on the number of times somebody views a title.
# Add feedback form and a mailto link ("or <a>email us directly</a>") to all pages except front page under the heading "Send us your feedback!"  Form lets user enter in an email address (not required) and a message with a "send feedback" button.    Emails to feedback@universalsubtitles.org

h2. End critical stuff

# Adding and deleting lines: http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12975
# Subtitle onscreen should change when user edits title https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/106
# Machine translation: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/109
# When browser can't play HTML5 video: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/114
# Show good error message when video link is broken / video removed from yt: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/9
# Expand widget when you submit video on site: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/95
# Behavior for user logging out during subtitle authoring http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12961
# Disable "Log in to save" message during &null session 


== Waiting on Morgan ==

# We need to see next subtitle in list in sync / review: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/96.  Morgan should style this and describe where/how the title should be kept centered.
# Style the "translate" interface (completely unstyled right now)
# https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/48
# shortcut sidebar style: http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12966
# Move sidebar to the right, make sure it doesn't stay in place when the rest of the widget scrolls
# better instructions: http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12967
# Fix Safari / Chrome CSS/XHTML errors (see email) ... test in IE7 / IE8 too.
# Pushable, animated shortcut buttons: http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12973
# Right now it creates confusion that you can't see the video playback slider unless you mouse over the video.  Design a video playback slider for HTML5 videos that is constantly part of the interface and doesn't overlap with subtitles.
# Remove the grey border around the blue instructions box (not the one on the side, the one "inside" the widget).
# The subtitles are too dark and don't stand out well on videos with lots of text in the bottom half of the screen (say, a news show).  Make the subtitles brighter (yellow with grey outline?) possibly looking at what VLC does for subs.
# An nice effect: the button would start colorless (even though it would look like a button) and start to glow green as you progress through the video.  When you hit the end of the video it would pulse green.  

== Non acted-upon suggestions from first round of user testing==

(I wanted to leave these somewhere as a reference)

* It would be useful to be able to change the subtitle text and color before completing the project; and also to be able to import a text file in the event the video had been transcribed earlier.  
* Adding a transcript: if somebody pastes a ton of text with linebreaks into the transcription box, we should treat those as separate lines and fill them in.  Two linebreaks is "silence".  Let somebody upload SRT.
* Make backspace (when not editing) work like "undo" for transcribe and sync, and show in key controls list.
* The "Start Over" link should be available on every tab.   In review, it should ask the user "do you want to delete all syncing information and start over?  Yes, delete all  /  No, just rewind to beginning" with No as default.  On the transcribe page it should say "do you really want to delete everything and start over? Yes, delete everything. /  No, don't delete" with no as default
* For morgan: restore start over button visibility.  Somebody thought it was too faint.
