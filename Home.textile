h2. Morgan's design list (top ones first!):

# Style google account login (the "gmail" link next to OpenID)
# Make HTML for this ticket (see the attachments and notes about the video link) http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13438
# Make HTML for "early testing stages" warning message in widget.  Should appear when user clicks and opens dropdown menu.  It can be wider than the video if necessary or it can wrap (maybe centered?).  Just make something and try it with different video sizes to make sure it doesn't look totally f'ed.  See attached screenshot (search email for the text of this todo)
# Make HTML that includes the howto videos and works with the right size, using the code from the "demo" / "testing"page on the universal subs site that  http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13422 ... ping holmes dmitry about where that code is.
# -We need a loading state for the login dialog. After the site/twitter/openid popup disappears, it tries to contact the server. This leaves the user thinking "wtf?" while the login dialog just hangs there, apparently doing nothing.-
# -HTML of revision history page (see email subject "Revision history page")-
# -Make ">" into small play buttons (that say "PLAY" and appear on hover over that item) in the "view" and "diff" revision history pages.-
# -fix text padding on subtitles in timeline.-
# when you click on the "subtitle me" tab under the video  and select something in the menu like 'add subtitles' the text doesn't turn white when you hover.  Whenever you roll over the text it's invisible since it's the same color as the background.
# -OpenID login screen needs to be styled.  Morgan-- let me know if there is any hold up on this.-
# -Add "Note this site is in early testing stages..." image from frontpage mockup to all internal pages.-  
# Timestamps in subtitle stack appear on the right margin with "left right" buttons to their left.   
# Currently to the left of the zero marker in timeline there's a difference of a pixel or two between the marked area and the blank area.
# Style "recent activity" with some kind of box around the whole thing (also on users' recent activity)  
# Style a nice way for empty subs to display "silence" or (silence) in a smaller but readable font, and email adam and holmes when done.  Should be implemented like this: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/84
# (Mini project: try to get widget down to 551 pixels (or as close as possible) 
* Change widget border style so that it appears like a "drawer" coming down from the top of the screen.  Video and top title almost flush with top of browser window (as close as it can without looking ugly).  Move close button down or somewhere else.
* Reduce height of subtitle list in sync mode to shorten the page.  As long as 4 long subtitles fit that's okay.
* Get rid of white border in favor of something simpler.
* While you're at it, get rid of the water mark for now.  
* Squeeze it vertically as much as you can without making it look bad or compromising function.  Maybe just shorten the height of everything 10% in addition to these other changes.  
#(New button design -- ping holmes for mockups via IM)
* Insert next subtitle now / start over / etc from new mockups
* Skip back
* in "beginner/default" play mode: Replay / Play next 8 seconds with replay grey out until option selected.  
* Done / back button from new mockups
* shopping cart style steps across the top.
* make "on deck" subtitle purple (or some other unused color) and make it that color in the list too).  Send adam a note to make a ticket if code change is necessary.

# create open-hand and closed-hand cursor files for dragging the timeline around. Some special instructions:
1. Here are the cursor files used by google maps:
http://maps.gstatic.com/intl/en_us/mapfiles/openhand_8_8.cur and
http://maps.gstatic.com/intl/en_us/mapfiles/closedhand_8_8.cur . The
google closure library already works with these.
2. To jive with the closure library, you'll have to specify a hotspot
of 7,5 in your cursor editing software.
** Morgan, adam suggested a tool in his email, but it looks like you can do with photoshop: http://www.google.com/search?q=cur+files+in+photoshop&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a

Other design wishlist (low priority):

# Design (or describe so that adam can easily code) a nice fade-in for the on-deck subtitle.  Should happen pretty fast, like 1 second.    On-deck subtitle should be 2 seconds long, centered in the empty space to the right of the playhead.  Show us a demo (if you can, if not just send a couple still images or something of it fading in) then send to adam to make ticket.
# The rotating logo isn't visible enough as a loading indicator.  One possible solution: replace it with a spinner that sits on the metal tab and temporarily replaces the green logo
# When the bottom left of an HTML5 video is very white, the button is sort of floating.  Perhaps the button should include an edge in the bottom left hand corner that goes up and right just enough to define that bottom corner, and fades from grey to white, one pixel wide?
# Fix funny white line below youtube video between youtube video and the rest of the widget.  
# We're thinking the green color on the "Subtitle Me" button and the logo looks way too pukey.   Can you make it brighter?
# Mockup a few other subtitle styles (white with black border.  yellowtext with black border and make active subtitle highlight yellow instead of blue).
# Mockup times sitting *on* the dividing line in a rounded or squared box, or maybe with no box at all, just the line ends and you see the time there.   
# Mockup: .X and + buttons show below the left / right buttons on titles in list (possibly in the middle of the title so you can't click accidentally)  to add and remove titles.  
# Make an intro screen we can use for all of our videos with the logo, a title for the video (e.g. Step 2: Syncing Subtitles) , and the brand.  send to everyone as original editable files
