h2. Morgan's design list (top ones first!):

Note, if the item refers to a screenshot, search email for some string from the item...  The email will include a screenshot.   or IM with holmes to resend screenshot.

# -Make HTML for pages 2 and 3 of revision history mockup (sent via email).-
# Fix style in the translation page in widget.  The instruction text is weirdly warped, the "choose language" area is unstyled.  The choose language box should be at the top of the subtitle list within the scrollable area.  This page should be the same height as other widget pages.  # Choose language in translation page in widget.  The label should be "Choose language: [ --- ]" and then "Choose Language: [Spanish]" when selected (send note to adam CC HW about what change needs to be made when you're done with style).
# -The youtube video isn't getting sized properly here (see screenshot in email of me translating one of our testing videos) - 
# -Make a basic "about" page with a Header and Lorem Ipsum / subheaders, etc etc for us to fill in.  Don't spend any time on this, just get something reasonably real.  If this already exists, just create an example page at /about- 
# -Make a basic FAQ page with a list of jump links at the top to Questions and answer text.  Don't spend any time on this, just get something reasonably real at /faq-
# Do a 1 hour round on style niceness for the timeline view (see email, and IM with Holmes when you get to this).  There will be lots of ideas here, so take a first stab at some of those top items while it's fresh in your head.
# -OpenID login screen needs to be styled.  Morgan-- let me know if there is any hold up on this.-
# -Add "Note this site is in early testing stages..." image from frontpage mockup to all internal pages.-  
# Make HTML for this warning message in widget.  Should appear when user clicks and opens dropdown menu.  It can be wider than the video if necessary or it can wrap (maybe centered?).  Just make something and try it with different video sizes to make sure it doesn't look totally f'ed.  See attached screenshot (search email for the text of this todo)
# Style a nice way for empty subs to display "silence" or (silence) in a smaller but readable font, and email adam and holmes when done.  Should be implemented like this: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/84

Other design wishlist (low priority):

# The rotating logo isn't visible enough as a loading indicator.  One possible solution: replace it with a spinner that sits on the metal tab and temporarily replaces the green logo
# When the bottom left of an HTML5 video is very white, the button is sort of floating.  Perhaps the button should include an edge in the bottom left hand corner that goes up and right just enough to define that bottom corner, and fades from grey to white, one pixel wide?
# Fix funny white line below youtube video between youtube video and the rest of the widget.  
# We're thinking the green color on the "Subtitle Me" button and the logo looks way too pukey.   Can you make it brighter?
