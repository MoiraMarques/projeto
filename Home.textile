h2. Critical Stuff for next round of development

# -Make sure youtube video is not covering subtitles on mac osx/ff-
# -Fix small problem (subtitles in overlay still advance when holding spacebar): https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/23-
# -Add an item to the dropdown menu "Download .SRT (ES)" that appears when a subtitle track is active-
# -"embed code" displayed on final "thanks for submitting" page of widget is not an embed code, it's just a link.  This field should include embed code, as shown on site (something that can be pasted into html to load video).-
# -Add some way in embed code to display subtitles in a given language by default.  (something like "autoplay=es" for spanish?? )-
# -Open ID login works https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/4 https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/89-
# -let users Create account (in widget in dropdown menu, and in login button) http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13079 / Create account page should be the same as login page on site, with a button that says create account.  Button in widget menu can say  "Login / Create Account".  (this page: http://mirosubsdev.8planes.com/widget/login/?next=/widget/close_window/) and then move it back to universalsubtitles.org/  ... right now at universalsubtitles.org/front/ (l: universal pw: subtitles) all links are broken.-
# -Add "turn off subtitles" to dropdown: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/88-
# New HTML (note: HTML mockups show lots of leading zeros, which I think we don't want / don't have... if we have them, get rid of them :)
  # Editing on timestamp: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/78
# Active subtitle should never display at the bottom of the list.  (After the 2nd or 3rd subtitle, keep it centered and scroll.... we want people to be able to see what subtitle is on deck.)

h2. Morgan's list.

* Morgan, can you cross these off when done?  These ones are done, right:

# dropdown: make the logo rotate slowly as a loading indicator.
# dropdown: make the "choose language" tab with the divder and down arrow (see layer in PSD nick sent).
# login window -> HTML
# Make HTML of transcribe/review with no 3D styling, edge around timestamps, just the text on the background, and make timestamp spinner buttons larger.
# Make video player (see email from Holmes)
# In "finished.html" (see email) Style the "Share" and "Translate" buttons, style the embed code, make a back button on "Return to Transcribe", generally, let's make this page look good.

h3. Fixes based on adam's work (more will probably appear here) ... See the email I sent for screenshots on some of these.

1. I need help with html/css for tab under video. Morgan, let's talk about this.
2. Without timeline, dialog is too short in sync & review modes.Elements on right overlap.
3. When clicking "Done" in Review state, we contact the server. Need
to show loading thing here.  HW: Let's use the first spinner (from the first widget, or something similar) right on the metal button in the space to the left of "Done"
4. In Sync or Review, try double-clicking on sub. The elements overlap a bit, so we need some design help here.
6. Finished state probably needs some design help.
7. Haven't tried youtube videos yet. Will try that tomorrow. Biggest
problem might be that they are too wide for the dialog structure.  Morgan--can you make a design that uses / sizes a youtube video?
8. grey dotted outline when you click in the widget dialog, this isn't a firefox extension, is it?  (see screenshot below)
9. White outline of widget is transparent.  It shouldn't be.
10. The subtitle text must be centered in the div and not in the video, so it sometimes gets too close to the left margin.
11. There's a band of white down the right side of the box, not covered by the subtitling image.  
12. Nick made a few tweaks to the dropdown CSS here (see email).  He changed the font, the positioning (left instead of right) and the menu color.  Can you incorporate these?
13. We're thinking the green color on the button and the logo looks way too pukey.   Can you make it brighter?
14. The rotating logo isn't visible enough as a loading indicator.  Can you replace it with a spinner that sits on the metal tab and temporarily replaces the green logo?
15. Safari video player and titles alignment bug (see two emails for screenshots) The video player in the widget view displays in the wrong place, even though the video displays in the correct place.  If this is some weird and hard to fix safari bug, let it stay broken.
16. Another Safari issue: I think the subtitles may be appearing too high in the video compared to the Firefox ones.  Not sure.
17. "Download SRT" shouldn't be styled as a link... it should look like any other button (see email screenshot)

h2. Non acted-upon suggestions from first round of user testing

(I wanted to leave these somewhere as a reference)

* It would be useful to be able to change the subtitle text and color before completing the project; and also to be able to import a text file in the event the video had been transcribed earlier.  
* Adding a transcript: if somebody pastes a ton of text with linebreaks into the transcription box, we should treat those as separate lines and fill them in.  Two linebreaks is "silence".  Let somebody upload SRT.
* Make backspace (when not editing) work like "undo" for transcribe and sync, and show in key controls list.
* The "Start Over" link should be available on every tab.   In review, it should ask the user "do you want to delete all syncing information and start over?  Yes, delete all  /  No, just rewind to beginning" with No as default.  On the transcribe page it should say "do you really want to delete everything and start over? Yes, delete everything. /  No, don't delete" with no as default
* For morgan: restore start over button visibility.  Somebody thought it was too faint.
