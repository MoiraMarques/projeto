== Waiting on Morgan ==

# We need to see next subtitle in list in sync / review: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/96.  Morgan should style this and describe where/how the title should be kept centered.

# shortcut sidebar style: http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12966
# better instructions: http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12967
# Pushable, animated shortcut buttons: http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12973
# Right now it creates confusion that you can't see the video playback slider unless you mouse over the video.  Design a video playback slider for HTML5 videos that is constantly part of the interface and doesn't overlap with subtitles.
# Remove the grey border around the blue instructions box (not the one on the side, the one "inside" the widget).
# The subtitles are too dark and don't stand out well on videos with lots of text in the bottom half of the screen (say, a news show).  Make the subtitles brighter (yellow with grey outline?) possibly looking at what VLC does for subs.
# An nice effect: the button would start colorless (even though it would look like a button) and start to glow green as you progress through the video.  When you hit the end of the video it would pulse green.
