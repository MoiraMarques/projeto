# -Subs site jumps when switching tabs in widget: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/77-
# -Focus should go to text-entry on TAB press: http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12969-
# -Change "Type Subtitle" to "Type subtitle and hit enter" and remove after the first time: http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12974-

h2. Critical Stuff for next round of development

# -Make sure youtube video is not covering subtitles on mac osx/ff-
# -Fix small problem (subtitles in overlay still advance when holding spacebar): https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/23-
# -Add an item to the dropdown menu "Download .SRT (ES)" that appears when a subtitle track is active-
# -"embed code" displayed on final "thanks for submitting" page of widget is not an embed code, it's just a link.  This field should include embed code, as shown on site (something that can be pasted into html to load video).-
# -Add some way in embed code to display subtitles in a given language by default.  (something like "autoplay=es" for spanish?? )-
# -Open ID login works https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/4 https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/89-
# -let users Create account (in widget in dropdown menu, and in login button) http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13079 / Create account page should be the same as login page on site, with a button that says create account.  Button in widget menu can say  "Login / Create Account".  (this page: http://mirosubsdev.8planes.com/widget/login/?next=/widget/close_window/) and then move it back to universalsubtitles.org/  ... right now at universalsubtitles.org/front/ (l: universal pw: subtitles) all links are broken.-
# -Add "turn off subtitles" to dropdown: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/88-
# New HTML (note: HTML mockups show lots of leading zeros, which I think we don't want / don't have... if we have them, get rid of them :)
  # Editing on timestamp: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/78
# Active subtitle should never display at the bottom of the list.  (After the 2nd or 3rd subtitle, keep it centered and scroll.... we want people to be able to see what subtitle is on deck.) 

h2. Critical things on the website

# "Recent activity" list of recently touched video on front page working or removed
# On site: All Videos" tab remove from nav or make it work / useful
#* make lists sortable (with up/down arrows)
#* fix "translation count" and display of translation numbers
#* some URL's are blank (are they Youtube videos identified by video iD? they should show youube URL).  
#* Remove transcription column since we're only allowing one,
#* Change "subtitles fetched" to "subtitles viewed" and have a number based on the number of times somebody views a title.
# Add feedback form and a mailto link ("or <a>email us directly</a>") to all pages except front page under the heading "Send us your feedback!"  Form lets user enter in an email address (not required) and a message with a "send feedback" button.    Emails to feedback@universalsubtitles.org

h2. Waiting on Morgan

# dropdown: make the logo rotate slowly as a loading indicator.
# dropdown: make the "choose language" tab with the divder and down arrow (see layer in PSD nick sent).
# login window -> HTML
# Make HTML of transcribe/review with no 3D styling, edge around timestamps, just the text on the background, and make timestamp spinner buttons larger.
# Make video player (see email from Holmes)
# In "finished.html" (see email) Style the "Share" and "Translate" buttons, style the embed code, make a back button on "Return to Transcribe".

h2. Non acted-upon suggestions from first round of user testing

(I wanted to leave these somewhere as a reference)

* It would be useful to be able to change the subtitle text and color before completing the project; and also to be able to import a text file in the event the video had been transcribed earlier.  
* Adding a transcript: if somebody pastes a ton of text with linebreaks into the transcription box, we should treat those as separate lines and fill them in.  Two linebreaks is "silence".  Let somebody upload SRT.
* Make backspace (when not editing) work like "undo" for transcribe and sync, and show in key controls list.
* The "Start Over" link should be available on every tab.   In review, it should ask the user "do you want to delete all syncing information and start over?  Yes, delete all  /  No, just rewind to beginning" with No as default.  On the transcribe page it should say "do you really want to delete everything and start over? Yes, delete everything. /  No, don't delete" with no as default
* For morgan: restore start over button visibility.  Somebody thought it was too faint.
