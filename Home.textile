h2. Morgan's design list (top ones first!):

# Fixes to revision history style (see email "Stylesheet fixes" from alerion)
# Timeline marker shows gab between seconds number and subsequent timeline vertical marker line.  
# Video in site displays misaligned (to the right 20px or so) because of clash between site CSS and widget CSS, adam says easy to fix.   test both Youtube and ogg.  Example: http://mirosubsdev.8planes.com/videos/tnQ4xO0Ghy9O/ 

Mini project: try to get widget down to 551 pixels (or as close as possible).  Mock this up and send to npr, dean, holmes for feedback before implementing.
* Change widget border style so that it appears like a "drawer" coming down from the top of the screen.  Video and top title almost flush with top of browser window (as close as it can without looking ugly).  Move close button down so that it doesn't take up vertical space... or move it somewhere else.
* look at "new button design" item... it may be helpful.
* Reduce height of subtitle list in sync mode to shorten the page.  As long as 4 long subtitles fit that's okay.
* Get rid of white border in favor of something simpler.
* While you're at it, get rid of the water mark for now.  
* Squeeze it vertically as much as you can without making it look bad or compromising function.  Maybe just shorten the height of everything 10% in addition to these other changes.  

New button design -- ping holmes for mockups via IM:
* see email "new button mockups"
* Insert next subtitle now / start over / etc from new mockups
* Skip back
* in "beginner/default" play mode: Replay / Play next 8 seconds with replay grey out until option selected.  
* Done / back button from new mockups
* shopping cart style steps across the top.
* make "on deck" subtitle purple (or some other unused color) and make it that color in the list too).  Send adam a note to make a ticket if code change is necessary.

# create open-hand and closed-hand cursor files for dragging the timeline around. Some special instructions:
1. Here are the cursor files used by google maps:
http://maps.gstatic.com/intl/en_us/mapfiles/openhand_8_8.cur and
http://maps.gstatic.com/intl/en_us/mapfiles/closedhand_8_8.cur . The
google closure library already works with these.
2. To jive with the closure library, you'll have to specify a hotspot
of 7,5 in your cursor editing software.
** Morgan, adam suggested a tool in his email, but it looks like you can do with photoshop: http://www.google.com/search?q=cur+files+in+photoshop&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a

Lower priority:
# Style a nice way for empty in the vertical subtitle list to display "silence" or (silence) in a smaller but readable font, and email adam and holmes when done.  Should be implemented like this: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/84
# Make a transparent PNG so that the truncated edge of timeline subtitles (always much longer than their box) fade nicely out and they reach the edge.


Other design wishlist (low priority):

# Design (or describe so that adam can easily code) a nice fade-in for the on-deck subtitle.  Should happen pretty fast, like 1 second.    On-deck subtitle should be 2 seconds long, centered in the empty space to the right of the playhead.  Show us a demo (if you can, if not just send a couple still images or something of it fading in) then send to adam to make ticket.
# The rotating logo isn't visible enough as a loading indicator.  One possible solution: replace it with a spinner that sits on the metal tab and temporarily replaces the green logo
# When the bottom left of an HTML5 video is very white, the button is sort of floating.  Perhaps the button should include an edge in the bottom left hand corner that goes up and right just enough to define that bottom corner, and fades from grey to white, one pixel wide?
# Fix funny white line below youtube video between youtube video and the rest of the widget.  
# We're thinking the green color on the "Subtitle Me" button and the logo looks way too pukey.   Can you make it brighter?
# Mockup a few other subtitle styles (white with black border.  yellowtext with black border and make active subtitle highlight yellow instead of blue).
# Mockup times sitting *on* the dividing line in a rounded or squared box, or maybe with no box at all, just the line ends and you see the time there.   
# Mockup: .X and + buttons show below the left / right buttons on titles in list (possibly in the middle of the title so you can't click accidentally)  to add and remove titles.  
# Make an intro screen we can use for all of our videos with the logo, a title for the video (e.g. Step 2: Syncing Subtitles) , and the brand.  send to everyone as original editable files
