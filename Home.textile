h2. Morgan's design list (top ones first!):

Note, if the item refers to a screenshot, search email for some string from the item...  The email will include a screenshot.   or IM with holmes to resend screenshot.
# HTML of revision history page (see email subject "Revision history page")
# Make ">" into small play buttons (that say "PLAY" and appear on hover over that item) in the "view" and "diff" revision history pages.
# fix text padding on subtitles in timeline.
# make video player black or dark, remove dividers btw play and volume and playback slider, build in to timeline marker bar with some nice subtle division (grey line?), reduce number of lines in marker to 4 and numbers to minute.seconds  like 4:20 for 4 minutes 20 seconds or 20 for 20 seconds. (see holmes mockup).
# subtitles that touch should be divided by a single thing line (no rounding)
# subtitles should display in bottom part of video (position moved up again)
# Get rid of "shadow" on subtitles in video.  
# make active subtitle light blue (same as in list)
# See email "Youtube sizing issue".  Was this done already and just not deployed? # -The youtube video isn't getting sized properly here (see screenshot in email of me translating one of our testing videos)- 

h3. Mini project: try to get widget down to 551 pixels.  

* Change widget border style so that it appears like a "drawer" coming down from the top of the screen.  Video and top title almost flush with top of browser window (as close as it can without looking ugly).  Move close button down or somewhere else.
* Reduce height of subtitle list in sync mode to shorten the page.  As long as 4 long subtitles fit that's okay.
* Get rid of white border in favor of something simpler.
* While you're at it, get rid of the water mark for now.  
* Squeeze it vertically as much as you can without making it look bad or compromising function.  Maybe just shorten the height of everything 10% in addition to these other changes.  


h3. List continues:

# when you click on the tab and select something in the menu like 'add subtitles' the text doesn't turn white when you hover
# Change "Submit Video" in front nav to "Subtitle a video"
# -OpenID login screen needs to be styled.  Morgan-- let me know if there is any hold up on this.-
# -Add "Note this site is in early testing stages..." image from frontpage mockup to all internal pages.-  
# Make HTML for this warning message in widget.  Should appear when user clicks and opens dropdown menu.  It can be wider than the video if necessary or it can wrap (maybe centered?).  Just make something and try it with different video sizes to make sure it doesn't look totally f'ed.  See attached screenshot (search email for the text of this todo)
# Make HTML for demo video (include an image there) and widget demo as in front page mockup.  
# Style "recent activity" with some kind of box around the whole thing (also on users' recent activity)  
# Style a nice way for empty subs to display "silence" or (silence) in a smaller but readable font, and email adam and holmes when done.  Should be implemented like this: https://pybrew.codebasehq.com/mirosubs/tickets/84
# create open-hand and closed-hand cursor files for dragging the timeline around. Some special instructions:
1. Here are the cursor files used by google maps:
http://maps.gstatic.com/intl/en_us/mapfiles/openhand_8_8.cur and
http://maps.gstatic.com/intl/en_us/mapfiles/closedhand_8_8.cur . The
google closure library already works with these.
2. To jive with the closure library, you'll have to specify a hotspot
of 7,5 in your cursor editing software.
** Morgan, adam suggested a tool in his email, but it looks like you can do with photoshop: http://www.google.com/search?q=cur+files+in+photoshop&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a





Other design wishlist (low priority):

# The rotating logo isn't visible enough as a loading indicator.  One possible solution: replace it with a spinner that sits on the metal tab and temporarily replaces the green logo
# When the bottom left of an HTML5 video is very white, the button is sort of floating.  Perhaps the button should include an edge in the bottom left hand corner that goes up and right just enough to define that bottom corner, and fades from grey to white, one pixel wide?
# Fix funny white line below youtube video between youtube video and the rest of the widget.  
# We're thinking the green color on the "Subtitle Me" button and the logo looks way too pukey.   Can you make it brighter?
