1. “Contribution” means any object code, source code, specification, documentation, or any related materials submitted by You to a Project, excluding any submissions that You clearly designate as “Not a Contribution.”

2. You hereby irrevocably transfer and assign to PCF, and agree to irrevocably transfer and assign to PCF, all right, title  and interest in and to all worldwide common law and statutory rights associated with the copyrights, copyright applications and copyright registrations in Your Contribution, to the extent allowable under applicable local laws and  copyright conventions, and agree never to assert against PCF any “moral rights” therein.  You understand that (i) this Agreement may be submitted by PCF to register a copyright in Your Contribution, and (ii) PCF may exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Your Contribution.    Upon execution of this Agreement, any license rights You may have in the Your Contribution will be governed by the license agreement under which the Project is licensed by PCF.

3. You hereby grant to PCF, and to any party who receives Your Contribution, a perpetual, non­exclusive, worldwide, no­ charge, royalty­free, patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer Your Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You and that are infringed by Your Contribution alone or by combination of Your Contribution with the Project to which such Contributions were submitted.  No patent license is granted hereunder for infringements caused by either: (i) third party modifications of Your Contribution or (ii) the combination of Your Contribution with other software or other devices if such combination causes the infringement.  

4. The assignment and licenses granted in Paragraphs 2 and 3 above are effective on the date You first submitted a Contribution to a Project, even if such submission preceded the date below.  This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and applicable U.S. federal law, without application of choice of law rules.

5. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the rights and privileges conveyed by this Agreement and warrant that  Your Contribution (i) to the best of your knowledge does not infringe any other party’s patents or trademarks; and (ii) does not violate any party’s other legal or intellectual property rights.
