h2. Brightcove

h2. Dailymotion

Dailymotion appears to support the entire API we need! Good job, Dailymotion!

h2. Metacafe

http://help.metacafe.com/?page_id=200

Metacafe has an embeddable player, but doesn't seem to expose an API. I could hack around and see if they have an undocumented API.

h2. Facebook

http://forum.developers.facebook.net/viewtopic.php?pid=194054

It looks like one can't even embed the FB player. Maybe we can scrape flv urls for FB?

h2. Yahoo

See http://developer.yahoo.com/music/api_guide/VideoPlayerMethods.html and http://developer.yahoo.com/music/api_guide/VideoPlayerCallbacks.html . Missing several methods we need, e.g. one that returns current playhead time.

h1. vidscraper supported sites: 

* blip
