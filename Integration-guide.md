<h3>Embed Code</h3>
Use the universal subtitles embed code (available on the video's subtitle homepage) to enable subtitles on that video, when you embed it on your site.


<h3>Header Script</h3>
This small bit of javascript can be added to the <header> of your template and then every video on the site (that Universal Subtitles supports) will have the subtitle tab attached below.

**To use it:** add <code> just above </header> in your CMS template. We also have a plugin that can do this automatically for wordpress sites.

**Demo:** http://universalsubtitles.org/widget/widgetize_demo.html

*Caveat: certain formats that we support must use the flowplayer skin, in order to give us necessary timing data so that we can sync the subtitles to the video.*


<h3>Universal Subtitles API for your player</h3>
The API allows any player to check for subtitles for a given video and then fetch a desired format
