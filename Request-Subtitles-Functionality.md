PLACES WHERE REQUEST DISPLAYS ON SITE


NOTIFICATIONS TO REQUESTER

* requester follows video?
* all languages (even ones that don't exist
* they can unfollow specific languages that don't matter to them.
* unbatched emails are okay for this.
* encourages

NOTIFICATION EVENTS:

* requested languages (that may not exist)
* When somebody starts on a request you made
* When somebody completes a request you made

NOTIFICATIONS TO POTENTIAL VOLUNTEERS

* Any time user receives any other notification, footer of notification email tells then other videos they can work on (top 3 requested in their language, or featured)
* User can choose to follow a language for requests ("Show me all language requests for Catalan") and let them choose "My languages", let them follow all requests.  GOES ON VOLUNTEER PAGE
* We can ask new users who speak not just English if they'd like to be notified of requests for subtitles in their languages (Takes them to the "follow languages" page or screen)
* List it in weekly update email (but should we focus on that now)  Also, requesting user  will have to wait up to one week, which stinks
* If < 100 users who speak a language: "You're one of just 25 users on our site who speak LANGUAGE.  We wanted to let you know that USERNAME requested subitltes for LANGUAGE subtitles for VIDEO TITLE".


We want an admin page where we can set thresholds like:
* > N requests sends out N notifications
* Send users N notifications per week, with requests batched OR top request
* Some users are heavy helpers, send high notifications to users with high response rates / large amounts of lines contributed

CREDITS / ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Where does requested status display?
* Video homepage (below languages list?)
* Request text: Comment on video info page (or pseudo comment that displays like a comment, not a comment)
* Page listing requested videos by sort. VOLUNTEER PAGE "most requested"
* Partially done stuff first
* Has language filters like: http://dev.universalsubtitles.org/en/search/, these are "from / into my languages" by default
* list of featured videos at the top (should these be filtered?)  admins would be able to flag videos as featured using simplest django backend way to do this.
* User can choose to follow a language for requests ("Show me all  language requests for Catalan") and let them choose "My languages", let  them follow all requests.
