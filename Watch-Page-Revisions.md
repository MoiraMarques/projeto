The overall goal of this project is to revise the current [Watch page](http://www.universalsubtitles.org/videos/) and [Search Results page](http://dev.universalsubtitles.org/en/search/) (currently in development) in the Universal Subtitles product. The revision should facilitate the discovery, watching and subtitling of videos.

Matt is working on HTML buildout of the project and should have the Watch page finished by WednesdayThursday, June 8/9. The Search Results page will be finished by Friday, June 10.

Here is the current visual documentation of the project:
